This folder contains critical references for the technical deliverables of the project. 
- **DARPA Zenith Technical Proposal**: Describes the work breakdown structure and provides an overview of the project.
- **Rosensweigh, 2014**:  Primary textbook in the field of ferrohydrodynamics. Check the first chapters if you're not familiar with ferrofluids. 
- **Mallinson, 1973**: Describes the Halbach array configuration that we will exploit to generate a constant, vertical magnetic force.
- **Romero-Calvo, 2020**: Describes the magnetic fluid interface model that we may use to compute the equilibrium of the ferrofluid interface.
- **Romero-Calvo, 2022**: Describes the fully coupled code that we may use to simulate the ferrofluid interface.
