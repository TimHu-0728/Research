# Experimental study
## Overview & DARPA Tasks
 This folder contains the CAD models, orders, and other design considerations associated with the design of the three 10 cm prototypes. The work done in this folder relates to tasks:
 - 1.5.2.1 - Manufacturing of 20 cm scale Halbach array setup using suitable magnetic configurations (3 months after start, due by the end of month 5)
 - 1.5.2.2 - Quantification and compensation of magnet magnetization error (3 months after start, due by the end of month 5)
 - 1.5.2.3 - Characterize the magnetic response of ferrofluids (3 months after start, due by the end of month 5)

## Work Breakdown for LGST Laboratory
The tasks that we need to accomplish to make this work are: 
 - [ ] Conclude preliminary design tasks so that we can move towards the experimentation/manufacturing phase (Lead: Hugh)
 - [ ] CAD a Prototype 1 Halbach array casing to test the design (Lead: Hugh)
 - [ ] CAD a Prototype 2 Halbach array casing to test the design (Lead: Hugh)
 - [ ] CAD a Prototype 3 Halbach array casing to test the design (Lead: Hugh)
