# Magnetic field codes
## Overview & DARPA Tasks
 This folder contains codes that simulate the magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet. The work done in this folder relates to tasks:
 - 1.3.1.1 - Quantification of inhomogeneities in the magnetic force potential induced by discrete Halbach array configuration as a function of magnet size and spacing (due after 2 months)
 - 1.3.1.4 - Sensitivity analysis of the magnetic force potential as a function of magnetization error (due after 2 months)
 - 1.3.1.5 - Quantification of mass force potential disturbances as a function of tilting (due after 2 months) 
 - 1.3.1.7 - Determination of feasible physical configurations (due after 2 months)
 - 1.3.1.8 - Design of axisymmetric Halbach array configurations (due after 2 months)
 - 1.6.1 - 0.5 m Laboratory-demo Halbach Array Magnet-level Design
